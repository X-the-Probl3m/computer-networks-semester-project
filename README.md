# CMPG325 - Computer Networks Semester Project (2025)

North-West University (NWU)  
Student Name: Sergio Mutisse  
Module: CMPG325

## Project Overview
This repository documents the complete development, configuration, and simulation of multiple computer network topologies designed and tested using Cisco Packet Tracer. The project was completed as part of a Computer Networks course, demonstrating both theoretical understanding and practical implementation of networking concepts.

The work is divided into two major phases:
1. Part 1: Fundamental Network Topologies
   This phase explores the design and behavior of standard network structures including Bus, Ring, Star, Mesh, extended-star topologies. Each topology is simulated to illustrate how data transmission, device communication, and fault tolerance operate in different network environments.
   The phase concludes with the creation of a Hybrid Network Topology, which combines the multiple topology types to simulate a realistic enterprise network setup.

2. Part 2: DHCPv4 Server Configuration
  In this phase, a DHCPv4 server is deployed to automate IPv4 address assignment within a computer network. The DHCP server assigns IP addresses dynamically to hosts across the network. This configuration enhances scalability, reduces manual errors, and simulates enterprise-level IP management.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding and implementation of different network topology structures.
- Integration of multiple topologies into a single hybrid design.
- Application of VLANs.
- Practical experience in configuring network services and troubleshooting using Cisco Packet Tracer.
